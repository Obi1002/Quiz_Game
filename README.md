# Quiz Game
For this project, I created a quiz game.  for this quiz, the player will lhave 90 seconds to answer five (5) questions. My main motivation for this project is to find a fun way to for players to exercise their knowledge on some of the with  passwords that meet several criterias and a length between 8 and 128 characters. To ensure the safety of the client's data, I have created a password generator that randomly assembles characters to build a very strong password. Being able to accomplish this passowrd generator will increase the safety of the client's data.
